# Language-Learning-Platform-Using-Python
Save the code to a file named app.py.
Make sure you have Flask installed (pip install flask).
Run the Flask application by executing python app.py in your terminal.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the vocabulary learning platform.
You'll need to create the index.html template file in a templates folder within the same directory as app.py. This template will render the vocabulary list fetched from the database and provide a form for adding new words.
